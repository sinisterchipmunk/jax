h2. Testing

Please come back after I've had time to work on this guide a bit.

h3. Testing your Application

This should be pretty straightforward, see the "getting started guide":getting_started.html#write-some-tests

h3. Testing JAX itself

# Clone "the repository":https://github.com/sinisterchipmunk/jax
# Run @rake install@
# Run @rake server@
# Visit the "local jasmine test suite":http://localhost:3000

Jasmine specs are hosted in @spec/javascripts/@.

Happy testing !
