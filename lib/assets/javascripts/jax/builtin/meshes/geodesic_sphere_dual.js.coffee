A Geodesic Sphere Dual mesh
Its faces are 12 pentagons and the rest are hexagons.
Of course, these are made of respectively 5 and 6 triangles,
almost equilaterals.

With 0 subdivisions, it's a dodecahedron (12 pentagons, 0 hexagon)
With 1, it looks like a football
With 2, it looks like a golfball
With 3 and more, it looks like a Civilization V map

Don't use it with more than 3 subdivisions

ยก THIS SCALES BADLY ! O(4^n) at least

Options:

* size : the size of the geode in units. Defaults to 1.0.
* subdivisions : the number of times each face is divided into 4 triangles before dualization. Defaults to 0.

Example:

    new Jax.Mesh.GeodesicSphereDual
    new Jax.Mesh.GeodesicSphereDual size: 2, subdivisions: 1

Demos:

* See geodes.js.coffee
